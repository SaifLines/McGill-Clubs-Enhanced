# McGill Clubs Enhanced

McGill Clubs Enhanced is a platform that makes McGill clubs more accessible to students. There is a lot of Clubs in McGill, all of them are offering interesting events and fun activities to the student community, but they are just too many to handle. not with MCE. 

An app that scrapes through McGill clubs newsletters, extracts the events that are organized by the clubs (event title, description, time, location, price if applicable), displays the events in a calendar view (think google calendar with events blocks).
